<p>Posted on 2020-10-26</p>
<p>I haven't kept a blog since 2016, and I kind of miss it. Writing is a great intellectual exercise, and keeping a blog also allows one to spread ideas and get feedback.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I haven't written anything is because the old blog had a very compact style that hasn't been popular in a while. It reflected a time when I only had a laptop with what was, even then, a sorry screen resolution. Looking at the web now on a 43" 4k monitor, I no longer mind the modern web's big fonts and margins.</p>
<p>The blog generator I wrote when I was new to Python was a bit messy. Though it continues to work surprisingly well and has some nice features. I could have just changed the style, but I thought I would see what I would come up with now after a couple of years of writing Python professionally. </p>
<p>The new one mostly has usability improvements. The posts are now written in markdown instead of HTML. This is less flexible, but easier to write. I'm not using special tags any more, for e.g. the date. Instead the "Posted on..." is just part of the post! Some of the features of the previous generator were interesting but not that useful - for example creating a list of posts whose title includes some keyword.</p>
<p>I will however add RSS support at some point.</p>
